## General Information

I built this project for an assignment, moreover, I wanted to improve upon the AniList Stats page by using more interactive charts. This project was built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and it uses the [AniList API](https://anilist.gitbook.io/anilist-apiv2-docs/) to fetch data. The data is displayed in charts that were created with [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) and [react-chartjs-2](https://react-chartjs-2.js.org/).

## Install

1. Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation).
2. `cd` to this projects' directory.
3. Run `pnpm install` to install the projects' dependencies.
4. Run `pnpm dev` to run the server locally.
